        <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person 
            couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal 
            human being could possess,</b> and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman 
            or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a 
            regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower 
            who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal 
            human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
